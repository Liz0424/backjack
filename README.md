## Instructions of running code file named main.py
**I just type the command 'python3 main.py' in the terminal to run the code with only used module called 'random' module and 'sys' module.**

## Assumptions to overcome any lack of clarity in the instructions 
**The following code shows about the situation that the dealer's point is equal tp player's points:**

 	

## Overall Performance on this project
**Basically, the project works in basic cases.**

## logics of coding 
**I use Object-oriented programming to write the code which could clearly show the process of game.**


## Improvements on this project given more time 
**If I have more time, I hope I can use only one class called Game to show the progress about how player and dealer play the game which could save time and memory.**

## What manual tests you ran on the code
**I just type the command 'python3 main.py' in the terminal to run the code, then you can type information which the code need to run the code.**
 
## How to run any automated tests you created
**I just type the command 'python3 main.py test.py' in the terminal to run the code, if there exists the code named test.py which can be used to test the results.**
